Creating this bridge allows her to create a special place for unbridled self expression. Sophia has constantly struggled since birth with finding a means of communication between the two worlds due to several learning disabilities. Through art she allows the world to view her inner self whether it be the stresses of everyday life to the struggles of being a person with disabilities in a world that seeks to constantly demean and discriminate those with disabilities. When her parents were told that Sophia would be severely dissabled both mentally and physically they had a choice to make. By believing what was in their hearts and in Sophia a healthy girl was born. However after birth it was discovered Sophia had a series of mental disabilities and was told she would never be able to achieve the same level as a person with no disabilities would at anything. Sophia is now defying all odds and is now a first generation college student who has earned numerous awards for community service promoting women in stem as well as the capability of disabled.
